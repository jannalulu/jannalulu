## Hello!

I'm a recent economics PhD graduate from George Mason University, where I evaluated the performance of LLMs by asking them to forecast future events under Tyler Cowen. I also work on attention-free models at FeatherlessAI, running evaluations on new models.

Always interested in learning new things and collaborating on various projects! Feel free to reach out : ) Twitter or email is the best way to reach me.
